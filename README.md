Forecasting is a process of predicting or estimating the future based on past and present data.

eg: How many passengers can we expect in a given flight.

    How many customers call can we expect next year?
    
Prediction modeling used to perform prediction more granular like who are the customers who are likely to buy a product in next month? and then act accordingly.


Machine Learning, it is a method of teaching machines to learn things and improve predictions/ behavior based on their own.
